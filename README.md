These are codes for a chatbot for an ecommerce website. Chatbot_Simple.ipynb is a simpler version, it doesn't understand complex language and only works when the user inputs a name for the product they're looking for (e.g., golf ball, lip balm, skateboard, toy car, etc.). Chatbot_Test.ipynb is supposed to work with more complex language with NLP. However, this is my first time doing something like this so it needs refining. (It may not work)
